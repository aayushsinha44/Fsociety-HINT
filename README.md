Twitter Utilities App:
This application project tends to solve three major real life problems that people encounter while using twitter. The app will only require your twitter handle as an initial input.

1.)	Predicting the number of likes and re-tweets that you might be getting on any tweet of yours, based on your profile status, and also based on the postâ€™s timestamp. It basically gives the idea that whether the tweet will be viral or not.

2.)	This app will help you get a summary of the tweets of the people you follow for the past one day ranging up to one week, as per your requirement. It makes life much easier as one can read all tweets in few minutes.

3.)	 Time to add some fancy stuff. Suppose you want to post a tweet in the style of some famous personality. This app will allow you do the same on the go. Just enter some text and the tweet will be generated in the style of your choice. Additionally, we will also predict the number of likes that you will get depending on when you post the tweet.
